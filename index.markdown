<h1>Welcome!</h1>
Soma Cultura is a virtual mental-health therapy practice that provides services to adult (18+ years) clients that speak English or Spanish.

Letâ€™s begin with some curiosity to see if our services feel right for you:

<ul><li>Have you noticed any patterns in your emotions or behaviors that are affecting your daily life or relationships?</li>

<li>Are there specific situations, memories, or experiences that are weighing on you that you'd like to explore?</li>

<li>Do you feel ready to commit to the process of self-exploration and healing, even if it may feel challenging at times?</li></ul>

If you are ready to be curious in a safe, confidential space, schedule your free 15-minute consultation today!
