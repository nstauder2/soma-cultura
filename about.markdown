<h1>¡Hola!</h1>

My name is Daniela Lopez-Vives and I am the Owner and Mental Health Therapist at Soma Cultura. Thank you for visiting and learning more about my practice!

Here are some things you may be wondering about:

<h4>What led you to become a therapist?</h4>
I love to be curious with others, and learn about each individuals’ stories and perspectives. It is a privilege to be in that space.

<h4>What is your professional background?</h4>
I have worked in academia/research for 10+ years in different health topics and have been in management roles in research and clinical settings.
I have been a therapist for 3+ years.

<h4>Why the name Soma Cultura?</h4>
<strong>Soma = Body and Cultura = Culture</strong><br>
I believe culture can reside in our bodies, by what we (and our ancestors) absorb from the world around us; whether its biological, physiological and/or psychological.

<h4>What is different about the way you approach therapy?</h4>
I like to consider the whole person in front of me, not just the symptoms they are presenting with; and, try to find what is the true etiology or root cause to what led you here. 
Some questions I wonder about in session: 
<ul><li>Have you been exposed to abuse or neglect? Have you experienced intergenerational trauma? </li>
<li>Have epigenetics and/or systems of oppression impacted your physical and emotional well-being? </li>
<li>Have you been listened to by medical providers and felt heard and seen in your story? </li></ul>

<h4>What are some modalities you use in therapy?</h4>
I like to use a combination of evidence-based practices, such as CBT, DBT, MI, mindfulness, parts work, somatic therapy and EMDR.
